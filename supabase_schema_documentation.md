## üîÑ Data Flow

1. A **user** signs in and is tracked in the `users` table.
2. They create or use a **world**, which links to a `story`.
3. When they begin an interaction, a **conversation** is created and tied to both the `user` and `world`.
4. **Messages** are logged within that conversation, alternating roles (`user`, `assistant`).
5. As users move through the **chapters** (within `stories.chapters`), their progress is recorded in `user_chapter_progress`.

---

## üí° Notes

- Use the `is_prebuilt` flag to separate system-generated worlds from user-created ones.
- Chapters are stored in `stories.chapters` as a JSON array, but referenced in `conversations.chapter_id` and `user_chapter_progress.chapter_id` as strings for lookup.
- Deleting a world should cascade or clean related conversations and progress records (handle with caution or with soft-deletes).

## üß† `story_context` and `chapters` Explanation

### `story_context` (from `stories` table)

The `story_context` field is a `jsonb` column storing all narrative metadata about the world. This includes:

- **Tone**: Overall emotional tone (e.g. Romantic, Dramatic, Whimsical).
- **Themes**: Narrative themes that influence decisions and dialogue (e.g. Power dynamics, Forbidden romance).
- **Setting**: Time and location data like company name, size, and era.
- **Characters**: Array of characters with:
  - Name, role, background (age, job, motivations)
  - Personality traits and description
- **Key Elements**: Driving forces of the plot, like tension types, emotional arcs, or hidden dynamics.
- **Initial Scene**: How the story begins, used to generate the opening experience for the user.
- **Relationship Dynamics**: Type of romance or interaction to expect, setting up key emotional beats.

### Example:

```json
{
  "tone": "Romantic, intense, slightly dramatic",
  "themes": ["Power dynamics", "Forbidden romance"],
  "setting": {
    "company": {"name": "TechTrend Innovations", "size": "Large"},
    "location": "Corporate office", "time_period": "2025"
  },
  ...
}
```

### `chapters` (from `stories` table)

The `chapters` field is a `jsonb` array representing the full chapter structure of the story.

Each chapter includes:
- `chapterName`: The title of the chapter (used for navigation and UI display).
- `objective`: A clear narrative goal or turning point (e.g. ‚ÄúGo to the masquerade ball‚Äù).
- `chapterContext`: The scene's atmosphere and events ‚Äî used to generate content during conversations.

### Example Chapter:

```json
{
  "objective": "Check in and go to your room",
  "chapterName": "The Lobby of Forgotten Time",
  "chapterContext": "You find yourself pushing open the grand hotel doors..."
}
```

These chapters are consumed dynamically in the app to:
- Guide the narrative flow
- Update user progress (`user_chapter_progress`)
- Track current location (`conversations.chapter_id`)

You can use chapter IDs (e.g., array index or unique key) to reference progress, unlock next chapters, and personalize future responses.
